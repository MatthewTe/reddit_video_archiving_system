You can also see their wingman at 10 seconds in the video. It looks like an SU-25, which makes sense since they tend to fly in pairs.\n\nTranslation of the conversation is:\n\nWingman: Are you okay?\n\nCrashed Pilot: Bro, everything is fine.\n\nWingman: Are you watching me?\n\nCrashed Pilot: Yes, I\u2019m watching.\n\nYou can see the vertical stabilizer cut in half, probably the cause of the crash. Likely surface to air being the cause, since that\u2019s how almost all Russian jets are downed lately, since Ukraine is so low on jets and trained pilots.\n\nAs a bonus, the field is an alfalfa field, which actually helps date the crash to the summer. [This one](https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/279443) is being mentioned a lot of places as well, since the pilot was captured, which could be how the footage was recovered. \n\nThe bort number on the tail is red 09, so maybe we can get some more details from that.
